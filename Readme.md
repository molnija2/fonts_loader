The qFontLoader program is designed to convert fonts from the operating system into hex codes of the .h file, for displaying text on the TFT display of the microcontroller. The program allows you to find a suitable font in the system (windows/linux), select the desired size, style and write it as a .h file. The user can set vertical or horizontal division into numbers, and select their bit depth from 8 to 32. The program itself generates a file name using the font name and options.
